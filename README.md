# ‼️BEFORE DOING ANYTHING DO THIS FIRST:
Create a Bootable USB Recovery Drive for Windows 10, this is essebtial as you could use it to recover or troubleshoot your system in case something goes wrong. This guide covers Ricing, Debloating, Privacy, Custom & Optimization tweaks which all has the potential to maybe just break something. Though this should not happen so don't worry, these tweaks, scripts, software and etc have been tested and used by a lot!

> [!NOTE]
> My thinking for the general direction of this guide/repo is the following:
> 1. First I'll start with the **debloating** and **privacy** stuff, after all it is ideal to have a nice clean system for the next
> 2. Then I will move on to somewhat a mixture of traditional **ricing** along with **tweaking** and **optimization**
> 3. After which I will recomend some general **software** to have
> 4. And lastly just some general stuff

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This will not be a too in depth guide as **a lot** of the resoures I will provide has guides or steps whithin them or is just straight forward and instructions is not needed.
